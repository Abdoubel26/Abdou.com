    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Every model that tries to design an artificial magnetic shield for Mars—whether planetary or regional—shares one major flaw: they're logistically impossible. They often solve the science but ignore the infrastructure. This research explores practical alternatives to protect a future colony by combining innovative thinking with modern capabilities in space, energy transmission, and electromagnetism.

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      This section outlines the approach used to assess the feasibility of a colony-sized magnetic shield. It includes estimating the magnetic strength needed, modeling energy requirements, selecting suitable materials and orbits, and evaluating power transmission systems.
    </p>
    <h3>2.1 Defining Shielding Requirements</h3>
    <p>
      Protection is focused on solar energetic particles (SEPs) and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). Based on Earth’s shielding baseline, the required field strength is 50–100 µT across the colony, assumed to span around 118 km²—roughly two Manhattan islands.
    </p>
    <h3>2.2 Magnetic Field Generation Model</h3>
    <h3>2.3 Superconductor Selection and Cooling Requirements</h3>
    <h3>2.4 Energy Requirements and Power Transmission</h3>
    <h3>2.5 Orbital Configuration Modeling</h3>
    <h3>2.6 Limitations and Error Margins</h3>
    <pre><code>R = √(Area/π)
= √(60×10<sup>6</sup> m² / π)
≈ 4370 m</code></pre>
    <p>
      Maintaining a strong magnetic field over 4370 m requires an impractically strong central dipole, revealing why conventional single-dipole approaches are unworkable.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Orbital Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      The shield should span a circular area with a radius of ~4370 m. Modeling field decay helps pinpoint how placement in orbit influences shielding strength across the colony.
    </p>

    <h2>Alternative Approaches</h2>
    <p>Alternate configurations include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Solenoids:</strong> Provide uniform internal magnetic fields.</li>
      <li><strong>Toroidal Rings:</strong> Confine fields into controlled loops, aiding plasma stability.</li>
      <li><strong>Nested Dipole Arrays:</strong> Combine multiple dipoles to spread field load.</li>
      <li><strong>Plasma Current Loops:</strong> Use ionized gases to reinforce magnetic fields.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="container">
    <h2>Conclusion & Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      While single-dipole designs demand impractical field strengths, new arrangements show promise. Future work includes simulations, coil optimization, and exploration of electrodynamic and plasma-based shielding methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      This research takes us one step closer to realistic colonization—maybe the next challenge is designing a Martian botanical garden.
